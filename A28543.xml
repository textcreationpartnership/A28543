            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Soon after he received alſo a Writ and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, ſent from <hi>Oxford,</hi> which declared the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Adherents Traitors, and authoriſed him to array the County for the <hi>King</hi>'s Service. The like Command other She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
<pb facs="tcp:50571:4"/> received: and the Sheriff of <hi>Eſſex</hi> that then was did thereupon addreſs himſelf to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, as if he would beg leave of them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Writ againſt them, and intreat their favour to declare them to be (what they were) Traitors. For which treacherous Flattery he had their Fatherhoods thanks, was careſſed, made their Treaſurer, grew rich, and to compleat his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is now Sir Baronet. But Mr. <hi>Coningsby,</hi> of another temper; according to his truſt and place; executes his Writ at <hi>S. Albans,</hi> and was there with the peril of his life (happy if he had then periſhed) taken Priſoner by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (who had the thanks of the Houſe too for his exploit) is carried to <hi>London,</hi> committed to <hi>London-houſe,</hi> where he continued Priſoner till the year 1643. and was then adjudged (by a then Committee-man, now a real Judge) to be within their Ordinance for Sequeſtration, though made after his fact, by virtue of thoſe words (<hi>Whoever have or ſhall:</hi>) as if he could have divined that any ſuch tranſcendent Impudence would appear in the world, as would confirm Wickedneſs, and puniſh Duty by a Law. And yet if he could, he could not have failed in his Duty; for <hi>he knew not fear.</hi> This was quickly ſmelt out by that famous Vulture Sir <hi>Will. Brereton,</hi> who alledged it againſt him, and that he had ſent one of his Sons into the <hi>King</hi>'s Army (true, but not proved:) and thereupon got the Sequeſtration and Plunder of his Eſtate; robbing
<pb facs="tcp:50571:5"/> him at once of more then two thouſand pounds. They ſeiſed alſo on his Real Eſtate, which then was not leſs then fifteen hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he is removed from <hi>London-houſe</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where with much barbarous uſage he was held ſeven years more, under ſeveral Gaolers; when at laſt broken and languiſhing in Body through Reſtraint, and Sickneſs contracted by it, his Son, by a pious deceit of bribing under-hand, and being bound for him, (who would never have conſented to his own Safety on thoſe terms, for his Generous Soul ſcorned to petition Rebels) gained him into the Country, where he found as great objects for his Grief as he did in thraldom it ſelf. For then he ſaw how during the time of his Impriſonment they had, beſides his Goods and Rents, waſted and deſtroied his Woods and Houſes, to the value of more then three thouſand pounds; and that in this ſeeming Liberty he did but behold his own and his Familie's Ruine at a nearer view, the Sequeſtrators and their Harpies continuing before his face to prey upon him and their own Maſters too, the leſſer Vermin preying on and cheating the greater, converting (as was afterwards made appear againſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King</hi>'s Commiſſioners ſitting at the <hi>Savoy</hi>) more then two thouſand pounds out of his Eſtate, from the general Sink to their own particulars, as he in the Satyriſt,</p>

            <p>In this juſt diſdain he offers to conteſt his Right againſt them at Law: But they, as if this had been the higher Crime, got an Order to impriſon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and breaking open his Daughter's houſe, in the greateſt inhumanity imaginable ſeiſed on him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſick and weak, inforce him to ride to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in great torment, and have him committed Priſoner to the Serjeant's man; where growing weaker then ever, and more diſcompoſed, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the ſame religious craft gained into the Country by his Son with a nominal Liberty; where ſoon after he was, in the year 1654, (after twelve years worrying) finally releaſed by Death.</p>
            <p>He was the Son of Sir <hi>Ralph Coningsby,</hi> who had for the more immediate Stemme of his Houſe Sir <hi>Humphry,</hi> a Wiſe and Learned Judge in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, but as to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Root, was lineally deſcended from a long and Noble Race of Anceſtors that were Barons of this Kingdom both before and after the Conqueſt. He was of a middle Stature, his Hair black, his Complexion ruddy, his Eyes black, full, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly piercing; in all ſo Comely, that thoſe who knew his youth would ſay, as the Prince of Poets does of his <hi>Deiopeia,</hi> that he was <hi>praeſtanti Corpore:</hi> but for his Spirit; ſo great and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:50571:6"/> that it was not at all to be bowed by Terrors or Miſeries, diſdaining in the whole ſtory of his Life to ſubmit his native and gallant Freedom to the frowns of any that were but his Fellow-ſubjects, though in greater authority, as was often proved. Once in a long Suit he had about a right of his Predeceſſors in <hi>Enfield Chace,</hi> with no worſe man then King <hi>James,</hi> the Judge then ſitting requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to produce his Evidences in Court. He ſaid he would produce ſo much as concerned the matter in hand. The Judge ſaid he would make him produce the whole, and that he would, if he could, pick a hole in them. To which he replied, That it were better the Skin were pluck'd over his ears, then that he ſhould ſit on that Bench to that purpoſe. The <hi>King</hi> being told it, and that it was taken as an Affront and Contempt of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſwore by his Soul, (his uſual Oath) that <hi>Coningsby</hi> ſaid right, and that he ſhould have right.</p>
            <p>He was of a nature ſo ſeverely and ſuperlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, that he would wrong no man; and, though it were to his prejudice, did not ſeldom protect others from wrong: and when he obſerved any man of Power doe wrong, he uſed to ſay, That man has kindled a Fire will burn his own Houſe. Out of this apprehenſion, when he was leaving the world, though he pardoned all perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, yet he did prophetically bequeath the <hi>old Cauſe</hi> and its Fautors to that Deſtiny ſome of them came to, <hi>the Gallows,</hi> ſaying, as a well-built
<pb facs="tcp:50571:6"/> Chriſtian might, That it was impoſſible that the righteous God ſhould permit them to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed alwaies. But
<q>Cur bonis viris mala fiant</q> is yet a riddle. He was a perſon of admirable Parts; but ſuch are too commonly the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate; and among his Misfortunes it was not the leaſt, that he had ſuch Parts, and wanted a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to ſtir them, and keep his large Soul from ruſt and Idleneſs. His laſt and great Character, which ſpeaks him born for this trying Age, was, that he lived and died <hi>Honeſt,</hi> preferring his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Loyalty to his Life, Liberty and Eſtate; chuſing rather to leave his Family which was nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but dear to him, (for a better Father never lived) poor and diſtreſs'd, then render'd infamous and ſtained by any unworthy act of his.</p>
            <p>His Misfortunes ended not with his Life; for after his Death his Eſtate was adjudged by the Rebels to be ſold, (by the name of <hi>Tho. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsby</hi> deceaſed) and his Son could not enjoy it but by purchaſe: by which means, together with his Piety in ſupplying and preſerving his Father, and his own conſtant Sufferings, he contracted ſuch heavy Debts, that he was enforced to ſell above one thouſand pounds a year, with his beſt Houſe, (built by his great Grand father, Sir <hi>Henry Coningsby,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt noble part of his Inheritance) worth more then ten thouſand pounds, not conſiderable in purchaſe. Sure no man can think he could doe
<pb facs="tcp:50571:7"/> this without the greateſt reluctancy and regret in the world, being the ſad Preſage of the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction and fall of that Family, and the juſt cauſe of ſorrow to ſucceeding generations, which more concerns him then his own Calamity: for as to himſelf, he yet inherits his Father's Mind, though not his Poſſeſſions. <hi>Fatum ſub pedibus dedit ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum.</hi> In the midſt of the Calamitous Times, (not forgetting his addreſſes to him who only can help) to alleviate his troubled Mind, he made Engliſh <hi>Lipſius</hi> his <hi>Conſtantia;</hi> ſo deceiving tedious hours, til it pleaſed Heaven to reſtore the <hi>King.</hi> Many then expected a Law <hi>de Repetundis,</hi> at leaſt againſt ſuch as were able and fatter Villains: but inſtead of this other things were done, in favour of ſome indeed, but to the prejudice (which was the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Partiality) of others, (as was made too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent before the Commiſſioners at the <hi>Savoy</hi> as before.) Upon this ruſh'd in a Deluge of Vices, whoſe rage broke down the former Banks, and divided the Affections of thoſe whom former Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries ſeemed to have faſt bound; thereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Fortune only, not Honeſty, was both their Pilot and Cement, and that they held together more out of Deſtiny then Vertue; of all men the moſt to be deteſted. This did the Son of this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Father dearly prove, and as ſadly conſider: for that he having better Principles of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> from him whoſe Bloud he glories in, and being willingly defective in what thoſe people
<pb facs="tcp:50571:7"/> boaſt of, <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> he found no worſer recompences from any then thoſe ſhould moſt have aſſiſted him.

                  <l>Such Good as is before defin'd;</l>

                  <l>We be deceived with a ſhow</l>
                  <l>Of Truth and Knowledge, nothing ſo.</l>
                  <l>But that there is, none can deny,</l>
                  <l>A fountain of <hi>Felicity.</hi>

                  <l>For whatſoe're <hi>imperfect</hi> is,</l>
                  <l>'Tis but what does <hi>Perfection</hi> miſs.</l>

                  <l>Something <hi>imperfect</hi> we do find,</l>

                  <l>Something that's <hi>perfect</hi> there muſt be.</l>
                  <l>For where <hi>Perfection</hi> there is none,</l>

                  <l>Nor from a lame <hi>imperfect</hi> thing</l>
                  <l>Does Nature her beginning bring;</l>
                  <l>But from what <hi>perfect</hi> is in all</l>
                  <l>She does into <hi>defection</hi> fall.</l>

                  <l>The common thought of humane kind</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>But we before concluded this,</l>
                  <l>What's <hi>perfect Good,</hi> that is <hi>true Bliſs:</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>True Bliſs</hi> in the high God ſhould be.</l>
                  <l>This is ſo ſtrong a truth, ſaid I,</l>
                  <l>None can gainſay it certainly.</l>
                  <l>But mark, I pray thee, then ſaid ſhe,</l>
                  <l>How thou approv'ſt inviolably</l>
                  <l>That the high God we did profeſs</l>
                  <l>To be repleniſh'd with <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>How's that? ſaid I. Thou doſt not ſure</l>
                  <l>Preſume that this ſame Father pure</l>
                  <l>Did ſo receive this <hi>chief Goodneſs,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>With the which he repleniſh'd is,</l>
                  <l>That it from any other came:</l>
                  <l>Nor doſt thou think but 'tis the ſame</l>
                  <l>To be God, who hath this <hi>Goodneſs,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And the thing had, <hi>true Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50571:52"/>
                  <l>For if that God did it receive,</l>
                  <l>He's better ſure that did it give.</l>
                  <l>But we do worthily confeſs</l>
                  <l>God all things does excell, all bleſs.</l>
                  <l>But ſince of God we now do treat,</l>
                  <l>If Goodneſs have in him a ſeat</l>
                  <l>By nature from a diverſe cauſe,</l>
                  <l>If he obeys another's laws,</l>
                  <l>Let him who can bring forth to light,</l>
                  <l>Who did theſe diverſe things unite.</l>
                  <l>Laſtly, whatever thing is divers</l>
                  <l>Cannot be that from which it differs.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore what from the <hi>chiefeſt Good</hi>

                  <l>To differ may be underſtood,</l>
                  <l>In its own nature's not the ſame;</l>
                  <l>Which wicked were of God to name,</l>

                  <l>(Who is the firſt ſubſtantially)</l>
                  <l>We may conclude moſt certainly.</l>
                  <l>'Tis true, ſaid I. But I did preſs</l>
                  <l>That <hi>chiefeſt Good</hi> was <hi>Happineſs.</hi>

                  <l>You did. Then <hi>God</hi> we muſt confeſs</l>
                  <l>Is th' only <hi>real Happineſs.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>By thy firſt precepts I did gain,</l>
                  <l>But theſe have made them far more plain.</l>
                  <l>Thus then more firm I'le make't appear:</l>
                  <l>Two ſoveraign <hi>Goods</hi> that diff'rent are</l>

                  <l>That <hi>two Goods</hi> cannot be the ſame;</l>
                  <l>So we muſt neither <hi>perfect</hi> grant,</l>
                  <l>While one <hi>Good</hi> does the other want.</l>
                  <l>And what not <hi>truly perfect</hi> is,</l>
                  <l>That cannot be the <hi>chief Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Wherefore the <hi>chiefeſt Good,</hi> we ſee,</l>
                  <l>Not poſſibly can diverſe be.</l>
                  <l>But we the <hi>chiefeſt Good</hi> averre</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Beatitude</hi> both are:</l>

                  <l>What's that? ſaid I. Since we confeſs</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>PHiloſophy with a ſweet voice</l>
                  <l>Did ſing this ſong, and kept a choice</l>

                     <hi>Decorum</hi> both in word and look;</l>
                  <l>When I abruptly undertook</l>

                  <l>Whatever yet thou haſt lay'd forth</l>

                  <l>And th' other not, then it is plain</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Power</hi> with <hi>good men</hi> does remain,</l>

                  <l>Which of theſe two moſt <hi>Power</hi> has,</l>

                  <l>To move by walking (thou'lt not then</l>

                  <l>The <hi>bad</hi> by Luſts (but all in vain)</l>

                  <l>The ſequel plainly does't deſcry.</l>

                  <l>This their Intemp'rance <hi>Weakneſs</hi> is,</l>

                  <l>By this from <hi>Strength</hi> they are ſo free,</l>

                  <l>For who the common end of all</l>

                  <l>Bad Fortune have, if they have pain.</l>
                  <l>It follows ſo. But who is wiſe,</l>
                  <l>Said ſhe, does think Adverſities</l>
                  <l>To be a trial, does make head,</l>
                  <l>And no more does the iſſue dread,</l>
                  <l>Then does the valiant Chieftain do</l>
                  <l>When to the battel trumpets blow.</l>
                  <l>The difficulty is the thing</l>
                  <l>Which unto both does honour bring:</l>

                  <l>The other is eſteemed Wiſe.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Vertue</hi> does its name derive</l>
                  <l>From <hi>Vis,</hi> 'cauſe it does ſtrongly ſtrive.</l>
                  <l>And you who in the progreſs are</l>
                  <l>Tow'rds <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſurely do take care</l>
                  <l>Not to be pamper'd with delights,</l>
                  <l>Nor to be pined with affrights:</l>
                  <l>But 'gainſt both Fortunes you put on</l>

                  <l>Leſt you Delights ſhould overflow,</l>

                  <l>For all his labour and his pain.</l>
                  <l>But if you will uprightly live,</l>

                  <l>For that may be <hi>neceſſary,</hi>

                  <l>There's a twofold <hi>Neceſſity:</hi>

                  <l>And may, or it may not befall;</l>
                  <l>As if thou ſee a man to goe,</l>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:50571:100"/>
                  <l>Then it is of <hi>neceſſity;</hi>

                  <l>For what thou know'ſt, that needs muſt be.</l>
                  <l>But the Condition does not draw</l>

                  <l>It does not from the Nature grow,</l>
                  <l>But the Condition makes it ſo.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Neceſſity</hi> did not compell</l>
                  <l>Him for to goe, or to ſtand ſtill;</l>
                  <l>But if he goe, it then muſt be</l>
                  <l>That he goes of <hi>neceſſity.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Juſt ſo, if <hi>Providence</hi> do ſee</l>

                  <l>There is not a <hi>neceſſity.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>But <hi>God</hi> at preſent does ſee all</l>
                  <l>That by <hi>free-will</hi> ſhall e're befall.</l>
                  <l>And this, if we do <hi>God</hi> reſpect,</l>
                  <l>Is <hi>neceſſary</hi> in th' <hi>effect,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>By that condition which alone</l>
                  <l>Is ty'd to the Divine notion.</l>
                  <l>But if that it conſider'd be</l>
                  <l>In its own Nature, it is free.</l>
                  <l>Without all doubt thoſe things ſhall be</l>
                  <l>Which Divine <hi>Providence</hi> does ſee:</l>
                  <l>And yet of them there are ſome ſtill</l>
                  <l>Proceed, not forc'd, but from <hi>free-will,</hi>

                  <l>By <hi>being</hi> they muſt needs be ſo;</l>
                  <l>Becauſe it might have been ſo, that</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>If by that ſame condition</l>
                  <l>Which is placed in <hi>God</hi> alone</l>
                  <l>They do ſo happen for to be</l>

                  <l>But yet before theſe came to paſs,</l>
                  <l>One of them <hi>neceſſary</hi> was,</l>
                  <l>The other not. So ev'ry thing</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Then rightly we do hence declare,</l>
                  <l>If things to <hi>God</hi> referred are,</l>
